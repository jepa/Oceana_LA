# Excecutive Summary

# Introduction

Latin American nations include the main fisheries regions of the world in terms of landings and, with a high (51%) proportion of net seafood production traded locally, domestic fisheries remain highly important for national food security. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that Latin American countries consumed around 6.2 million tons of fish in 2015, averaging a per capita food fish consumption of 9.8 kg/year. The contribution of fisheries’ to food security and livelihoods is particularly pertinent given the ongoing World Trade Negotiations on fishery subsidies disciplines, as these are partially intended to avoid trade and operational distortions that may threaten local food security in maritime nations.

In 2016, total fish landings in Chile and Peru, two of the world’s top fishing nations, averaged 8 million tons per year [@Fishstat]. In Peru, the seafood sector generates over US 1.7 billion per year, supporting over 200 thousand jobs3. Moreover, Chile’s aquaculture production is among the largest of the world1 and fish meal and salmon exports generate over US$2.2 billion per year4. Despite comparatively lower catches, Brazil’s fisheries sustain thousands of local families in coastal areas5-6, and inland captures are among the largest of the world1. In Latin America size matters as 90% of Landings from small scale fisheries (SSF) are paramount in Latin America, as 90% of all motorized fishing vessels are under 12m
length1. However, this sector is among the most marginalized groups in the region 7, despite it being critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1, “Eradicating hunger,” as highlighted by the recent FAO small scale fisheries guidelines that explicitly links the sector with food security and poverty eradication [@Fishstat].

Given the increasing pressures on vulnerable populations, including climate change but also rapid policy and market shifts, it is imperative to highlight the critical importance of particular capture fisheries for meeting domestic seafood supply. This knowledge can help guide future policies to ensure economic development does not jeopardize health and livelihoods in (particularly coastal) communities.

# Methods

The objective of this project, for each nation considered, was to determine the domestic seafood consumption (regionally, as possible) and its relationship with local employment in wild capture fisheries. Given that seafood is a widely traded commodity and that aquaculture has steadily increased supply into markets, meeting this objective will involve using species-specific data on domestic catches, aquaculture, and seafood imports and exports in order to highlight the most important species and fisheries for contributing to local and national food security.

Figure 1 below is a conceptual diagram of the anticipated methods to be undertaken in each nation. These methods directly link to the objectives proposed in the project Terms of Reference. Given the nature of fisheries data and governance systems, we anticipate that each of the nations considered will present unique challenges. Nevertheless, the overall approach (as captured in Fig. 1) will be used to maintain consistency in methods and comparability of results across nations, of course acknowledging specific uncertainties as appropriate.

Based on the best available data in each country, total seafood supply will be estimated as the sum of per-species production of domestic catch and aquaculture (minus exports), plus the sum of species specific net imports. Catch statistics will also be broken down by sectors whenever possible, including artisanal, industrial, and subsistence catches. In the case of domestic catch, inputs to aquaculture are subtracted from production (similar to exports); this is anticipated to be particularly relevant for large industrialized fisheries for small pelagics that are almost entirely reduced into fish feeds for aquaculture. The distribution of consumption (demand) of this seafood supply will be based on regional (as available) estimates of seafood consumption per capita and regional populations. An important additional aspect for the critical analysis portion of the project will be to link these regions with available socioeconomic and governance indicators, providing a basis for discussing relative vulnerabilities to potential
changes in seafood supply.

## Analysis

In the following section you will find the detail methods of estimating *i*) seafood supply and *ii*) revenues from fisheries landings as well as trade and aquaculture. Such analysis was applied across all countries using different datasets. Results will vary within countries according to the dataset (source) used.

### Estimations of National Seafood Supply

We used the framework proposed (Figure 1) to design a model to estimate total seafood supply. The model included fish providing from for wild (ocean) domestic catch, farmed fish, and trade. In addition, estimations accounted for discards at sea (e.g. di-gutting and overall fish cleaning), rate losses at wild fish and aquaculture processing plants (e.g. 10 kilos of a certain fish might produce only 4 kilos of actual fish by-product) (See Table 1 for a summary of all variables).

```{r NSS_Variables, eval = T, echo = F}

data.table(
  Symbol = c(
    "C",
    "A",
    "I",
    "E",
    "D",
    "O",
    "P",
    "L",
    "TDFS",
    "NDFS",
    "TFS",
    "NSS"
  ),
  Description = c(
    "Fish catch, i.e., wild capture production.",
    "Aquaculture production.",
    "Fish imports.",
    "Fish exports.",
    "Rate of losses () from discards (D) at sea.",
    "Rate of losses from other uses (O), i.e., not for human consumption.",
    "Rate of losses from processing (P), i.e., during canning, filleting, etc.",
    "Landings from wild capture production (catch minus discards).",
    "Total domestic fish supply. Total amount of fish produced in the country.",
    "Net domestic fish supply. Total amount of fish produced in the country, minus exports and discards.",
    "Total fish supply. Total amount of fish in the country (NDFS plus imports).",
    "Net seafood supply. Effective amount of fish for human consumption in the country (TFS for human consumption, minus processing waste)."
  )
) %>% 
  # kable("latex", booktabs = T) %>% 
  # kable_styling(full_width = F) %>% 
  #  column_spec(2, width = "15cm") %>% #wraps text in column2
  kable()

```

The model first estimated the total domestic catch of fish supply per species (*i*) from wild captures and aquaculture as follows:

$${TDFS_i} = {C_i} + {A_i}$$

Note that, to avoid double-counting fish production, domestic catch that is fed to farmed fish was subtracted from overall production. This was done as possible given available country information and context (i.e., this may be more of an issue for some countries than others). Then, not domestic fish supply was estimated from fish landed (catch minus discards), aquaculture and exports as follows:

$${NDFS_i} = {L_i} + {A_i} - {E_i} $$



$${L_i} = {C_i} - ({C_i} * {\lambda_{d,i}} )$$


where the second term in Equation 3 allows for a calculation of total discards in each country.
In Equations 4 and 5, we assume that all imported seafood (we do not include imports not for human consumption, e.g., fish meal) is ready to be consumed and thus do not include losses from processing. We also assume that all aquaculture production is for human consumption and that none of this production is discarded, though processing losses do occur as in production from capture fisheries (e.g., farmed and wild caught shrimps would receive similar processing).


$${TFS_i} = NDFS_i + I_i$$

Therefore, national seafood supply will be estimated for each country and species as follows:

$$NSS_i = [(L_i - L_i * {\lambda_{o,i}} + A_i] * {\lambda_{p,i}}- E_i + I_i$$


### Estimations of National Economic Participation

Estimations of economic participation of fish in each country was computed based on fisheries landings, trade, aquaculture, and market value. Note that landings will have different ex-vessel price depending in the buyer (e.g. direct human consumption, fish meal or fish oil).


```{r NEE_Variables, eval = T, echo = F}

data.table(
  Symbol = c(
    "beta",
    "alpha",
    "I",
    "RI",
    "E",
    "FR",
    "NT"
  ),
  Description = c(
    "Ex-vessel price for catch landed for direct human consumption",
    "Ex-vessel price for catch landed for indirect human consumption",
    "Imports. Economic value of imported fish",
    "Re-Imports. Economic value of fish products re imported in the country",
    "Exports. Economic value of exported fish",
    "Fishing Revenue. The total revenue for that species provided by the fishing activity",
    "Net trade. Economic value of fish traded considering both exports and imports"
  )
) %>% 
  # kable("latex", booktabs = T) %>% 
  # kable_styling(full_width = F) %>% 
  #  column_spec(2, width = "15cm") %>%  #wraps text in column2
  kable()

```


Fishing revenue integrates the different ex-vessel price that landings have, depending on the final destination: direct human consumption (DHC) and indirect human consumption (IHC). Therefore, total revenue (*R*) is estimated in the SAU database as follows:

$$FR = \sum_{i = 1}^n (L_{i}*\beta_{i})*\beta P_{i} + (L_{i}*\alpha _{i}) *\alpha P_{i}$$

In addition to the landings data, we used the FAO (SOFIA 2016) database to determine the value (US dollars) of fish and crustaceans, mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates imported and exported by Brazil, Chile and Peru. We estimate the net trade (*NT*) as follows:

$$NT = (E-I)-RI$$

#### International Analysis

The first approach that we did was to determine domestic seafood consumption, and its relationship with local employment in wild capture fisheries from international databases. While this first step represents the most broad analysis, it gives an idea of general country-level trends as well as information available to focus at more specific levels. The international analysis done using three main datasets:

1. The FAO-SOFIA Catch and trade database.
2. The Sea Around Us Dataset (SAU) has reconstructed fisheries catches for all three countries dating from 1950 to 2014. These data present a more accurate and complete picture of global fisheries than nationally collected data (nor the FAO dataset) [@Zeller2016]. Data extracted from SAU for Chile included the islands Juan Fernandez, Easter, and Desventuradas. For Brazil landings data included Fernando de Noronha, St Paul and St. Peter Archipelagos, and Trindade & Martim Vaz islands.
3. A recent study estimated the proportion of fish landings designated to human direct consumption and fish meal and fish oil[@Cashion:2018]. Such study used the SAU database, internal reports and other methods for estimating total landings devoted to each segment for all countries in the world.
4. The FISHMAR database for names homologation. 

For the former analysis we used the FAO database to estimate the total landings (tons) of Chile, Brasil, and Peru in 2014, the last year with results in all database. All fishing sectors were aggregated (Industrial, Subsistence and Artisanal) and ** COMMENT: "Recreational" was ignored as it does not contribute to local food security.** Other countries that fish within Chile, Peru and Brasil were also not included in the analysis for the same reason. Landings were grouped by taxa excluding those not identified (e.g. "Marine fishes not identified"). We used the SAU database under the same method to estimate the revenue (US dollars) from each fishery.The SAU landings database reconstruction methods for each country can be accessed for Brazil[@REF], Chile[@REF], and Peru[@REF]. We then used the Tim *et al., 2018* database to estimate how much of the landings go to direct human consumption and how much goes to indirect human consumption...

# Results

the results section is divided in two main subsections representing international datasets (*International results*) and local datasets (*Brazil/Chile/Peru*). Results follow the same structure for each country from a fisheries context to a fish consumption supply to an employment and income section.

Overall results show the average value of the last 5 years of data, although data provided along with this report dates several years ago.

## International

### Fisheries Context (General)


Results from the international analysis shows a clear dominance in fisheries landings of both Chile and Peru over Brazil, even thou Brazil captures around 3 times more species than the former. In terms of total fishing revenue, all nations are similar (**Table XX**)

```{r Total_Table, eval = T, echo = F}

Totals <- SAU_Database %>%
  group_by(Reporter,Variable,scientific_name) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean,na.rm =T) %>% 
  group_by(Reporter,Variable) %>% 
  summarise(
    "Totals" = round(sum(Value,na.rm=T)),
    "Exploited Species" = n()
  ) %>%
  tidyr::spread(Variable,Totals)


International_D %>%
  gather("Variable","Value",5:12) %>% 
  group_by(Country,Comm.Name,Sci.Name.Fb,Variable) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean,na.rm =T) %>% 
  group_by(Country,Variable) %>% 
  summarise(
    "Totals" = round(sum(Value,na.rm=T))/1000, #Thousands
    "Exploited Species" = n()
  ) %>%
  filter(Variable %in% c("Aquaculture","Capture","Exports","Imports")) %>% 
  tidyr::spread(Variable,Totals) %>% 
  kable(
    
    caption = "Summary of results. Database used: SOFIA-FAO. Thousand tonnes"
  ) 

```

When we analyze the top ten species in terms of landing volume (tons) and value (USD) using the SAU database, we find different trends between and within countries. Brazil's most prolific fishery in 2014 was *Umbrina canosai*, a croaker fished in the southern part of the country, however, the most exploited specie (in terms of landings) was the ray-finned fish *Sardinella brasiliensis*. For Chile, the most valuable and landed fishery was *Engraulis ringens*, Peruvian anchoveta. Finally, Peru most valuable fishery in 2014 was the Peruvian scallop *Argopecten purpuratus* but like Chile, *Engraulis ringens* was the most landed species (**Fig. XX**).

In addition to the internal fish production, Brazil, Chile and Peru all import and export fish (**Fig. XXX**). According to the UN data, Brazil spends more money importing fish than what it makes from producing it and exporting that production. In the other hand, both Chile and Peru have positive surplus from their fisheries and commerce activities being Chile the most "*profitable*" country.
