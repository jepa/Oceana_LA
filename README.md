# Overall project information
This is the repository for the Oceana project on most important fisheries in Brasil, Chile and Peru.

## Project Goals:

1) Domestic fish consumption: aims to identify the top domestic fisheries in the country that contribute to domestic seafood consumption, as well as the relative contribution of other sources of seafood (e.g. aquaculture, inland capture, foreign).

2) Fisheries employment and income: aims to identify the top domestic fisheries contributing to employment and income of people involved in fish-related activities (e.g. harvesting, processing, selling) in the country.

3) Fisheries context: aims to identify the top domestic marine fisheries in terms of volume and value in the country.

4) Critical analysis: aims to provide a discussion based on the research components described above and our own expertise. In addition, it looks to identify the caveats and assumptions of the implemented analytic approach as well as suggestions for future research projects to address these shortfalls.

## Folders organization:

- **cleaning_databases:** This folder holds all the clean databases for the project per country and also the international analysis.

-- *Project_Metadata.csv:* This file contains the information about all the databases of the project

- **Functions**: Any function needed for the project. Functions should have explanatory text and examples build within.

- **International**: This folder contains the script used for cleaning the international analysis part. And data.

-- *raw_databases*: This folder contains databases in "raw" format that need to be cleaned for delivery to *Oceana*. Spatial data does not to be included in final report but need to be here for knitting the report

- *Oceana_Ref.bib*: BidText file containing all the references in the project

- *Report_Figures*: Include figures nor produced by code or figures that will take too long to produce
